# .NET International Data Spaces (IDS) Client

For the requirements of the [CO2Path project](https://www.co2path.io) in the [REACH Incubator](https://www.reach-incubator.eu) we have converted the OpenAPI specifications of the [IDS Connector](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/DataspaceConnector/blob/main/openapi.yaml), to a Microsft .NET Client API. Many helper functions have been added to make the usage easier.

Also included is a unit test, that runs in C# all the tests in the `TestbedPreconfiguration.postman_collection.json` Postman collection. The workflow in the series of tests run correctly in the default setup of the Broker/Connectors in the testbed, https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed
